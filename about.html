          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on web projects you can usually find me out on the water, indulging in my favorite
            hobby stand up paddle boarding otherwise I'm gaming üéÆ.
            <br />
            I also ‚ù§Ô∏è spanding time with my family and out two beloved ragdoll cats üêà.
            <br />
            As a student of front-end development I am dedicated to learning as much as possible about the field.
            Therefore I'm taking online courses via SheCodes.com. Through these courses, I'm gaining a deep
            understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            With each lesson, I'm aquiring techical knowlegde, and learning how to design user-firendly and visually
            appealing interfaces.
            <br />
            I am a dilligent problem-solver always looking for creative ways to complex challenges.
            And this is why I'm appreciating the flexibility of online learning as it allows me to study at my own pace
            and fit it into my schedule. The Supportive community and expert guidance offered by SheCodes.com have been
            invaluable in keeping me motivated and inspired throughout this process.
            <br />
            Stay tuned for updated in my progress, and feel free to reach out if you have and tips or suggestions!
